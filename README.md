# TensorCAS
An in-dev computer algebra system for tensor calculus built on CASprzak and built by Erez Israeil Miller for eventual GR applications.
README will be updated when the project is formally complete, but some current features are:
- Creation of arbitrary `Tensor`s from CASprzak `GeneralFunction`s
- Tensor operations such as sums, products, and partial derivatives, with built-in tensor contraction
- Construction of `Space`s from a metric 
- Calculation of Christoffel connections
- Covariant derivatives
